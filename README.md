# Python Facial Emotion Based Typeface
This project detect your facial emotions using Keras AI model and I have used variable fonts for customizing the typeface based on the emotion values.
<br>
<br>
A high "happy" emotion value makes the font more "smoother" and
<br>
a high "angry" emotion value makes the font more "spiky".
